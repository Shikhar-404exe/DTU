🌍 The Problem We’re Solving

Imagine being a student in a remote village. Your school might have a few smartphones or tablets, but stable internet access is never guaranteed. Online learning platforms exist, but instead of helping, they often become reminders of what you cannot access.
This is not an isolated situation. It reflects the reality of millions of students across India. Nearly 60% of the rural population struggles with consistent internet access, widening the education gap every year. While urban students benefit from AI tutors and unlimited online resources, many rural students are forced to rely only on outdated or limited offline material.

We believed this gap was unfair—and solvable.

💡 Our Idea
Introducing Vidyarthi, a learning platform designed to work even when the internet doesn’t.

The core idea is simple yet powerful:
What if one student with occasional internet access could help 50 others learn for weeks or even months?

How We Make It Happen
Think of it like sharing handwritten notes in school—except smarter, faster, and powered by AI.
The Power of QR Codes
One student gets temporary internet access (school, library, café)
Uses to generate AI-powered notes and quizzes
Creates a QR code in seconds
Other students scan the QR code using their phones
Instantly receive notes and can generate unlimited quizzes offline
No repeated downloads. No heavy files. No internet dependency after sharing.

8 AI Helpers That Work Offline (simulation based) and online (API based).
app includes eight lightweight AI agents that operate directly on the user’s device once content is generated:
One plans study schedules
One clears doubts
One simplifies difficult concepts
One generates quizzes
Four others support collaboration, revision, and learning continuity
After initial setup, everything works offline.
Real-World Impact

Consider a student like Priya from a village in Bihar. She gets internet access once a week at school. Using App, she generates detailed Physics notes and creates QR codes. Her 45 classmates scan them.
For the entire month, all students can:
Read structured notes
Generate fresh practice tests daily
Receive explanations for answers
Track learning progress
All without internet.
